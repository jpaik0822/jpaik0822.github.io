### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was one of my favorites as we had to make a guessing game. I enjoyed having to employ numerous if statements layered together to fulfill all the different scenarios the game could take.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 3 was very interesting as we were making animations in our terminals using symbols and lines. It was unique, using new tools like chrono_literals and 2000us in order to make the animations work correctly. 

* Lab 9

    In lab 9, part 2, we needed to find in a list of words which were misspelled. This was one of my favorites because it was challenging using ifstream while also implementing numerous functions to locate the words that did not match the others.
